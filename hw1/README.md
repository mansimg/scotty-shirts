# SSUI-homeworks

HW 1

Most of the testing I have done with the site is interactive (checking on my local version and seeing if the features
behave the way I expect). I tested to see if the components were laid out in the right location, as well as if interactions
were being registered correctly. To check the handling of default cases, I have added some other test cases in shirts.js.

I also added the quickview (for extra credit).
